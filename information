I have a remote server connection with a jupyterhub running on it.l

We are using Vagrant and Ansible for that and we need to add new users to the jupyterhub.

Unfortunately I don't know how to do it and I would need some help.



Some documentation files exist.
For the task the user would need to connect with me via TeamViewer to do it.

Further details can be discussed in Chat.


What I know is that this can be done following these steps:

-make vagrant
-change directory
-Ansible-vault edit vault
